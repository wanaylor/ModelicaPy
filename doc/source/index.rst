buildingspy
===========

*buildingspy* is a `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_
package that can be used

 - to run Modelica simulations using
   `Dymola <http://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola>`_,
 - to process ``*.mat`` output files that were generated by
   Dymola or
   `OpenModelica <https://www.openmodelica.org/>`_,
 - to run unit tests as part of the library development,
 - to refactor Modelica libraries, and
 - to merge the `Annex 60 <https://github.com/iea-annex60/modelica-annex60>`_ library to other
   Modelica libraries.

The package provides functions
to extract data series from the output file for
further use in the python packages
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
for plotting and
`SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ for scientific computing.
